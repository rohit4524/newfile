                  :>Started schooling at <strong>INFANT JESUS SCHOOL</strong>.It was the best phase which consists of the most beautiful and funny memories of my life. The line is correct that <u><em><strong>School life starts also with the tears and ends-up with the same too. </strong></em></u> My school life was also the same like evry1. It started with my tears as starter. Later, It was a complete main cousre with ingredients like frienships, fights, crushes, punishments and enjoyments. And at last, it ends-up with memories as deserts.<br> 
                                                The best what happened to me is still the connections and the friendship with some of my school friends among which, the most important are these two.<br>

                     :>These 6 months had gone far good than my expectations. WONDERING HOW ?? <u><em>The answer is below.</em></u><br>
                     ->Though the taste of mess food isn't delicious, but eating it with ur crazy friends along with their talks make it good.<br>
                     ->Though the classes are boring, but sleeping in those classes with ur bench mates has it's own fun.<br>
                     ->Though u don't study the whole semester, but studying the whole syllabus in the last night before exam has it's own fun.<br>
                     ->Though u are away from your family, but spending time with the family <em><u>full of F.R.I.E.N.D.S.</u></em> has its own excitement.<br>
